# SECTION 1 â€“ PROJECT PROPOSAL

### Project Name: ToDone

**ToDone** is a simple and user-friendly to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, complete, and clear tasks using an intuitive, minimal interface optimised for mobile-first design.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Purpose

The goal of ToDone is to support users in managing day-to-day tasks efficiently without the complexity of login systems, notifications, or syncing. The app is ideal for time-pressed users such as:

- A student juggling coursework deadlines across multiple modules
- A junior analyst managing daily stand-up actions
- A busy professional wanting a lightweight personal checklist

Simplicity is not a limitation, but a conscious design choice to reduce friction, minimise cognitive load, and support task clarity. By removing unnecessary features, ToDone becomes a productivity tool that empowers autonomy and focus.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Rationale

This project was selected because of its:

- Simplicity and clarity â€“ easy to implement with front-end technologies
- Strong modular design potential â€“ aligns with best practices in software architecture
- Suitability for agile planning and iterative delivery â€“ enabling the use of modern project management and CI/CD pipelines

It provides a solid platform to demonstrate:

- Planning using GitHub Projects
- Incremental development with Git
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions

---

### ðŸ”¹ Relevance to Workplace

While this app is not yet a client-facing product, it serves as a testbed for applying professional software engineering practices used in workplace environments. These include:

- Kanban-based agile planning via GitHub Projects
- Branching and pull request workflows for version control
- Test automation foundations using GitHub Actions

The project reinforces industry-relevant capabilities in iterative delivery, automation, and UI responsiveness.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Learning Outcome Alignment

ToDone offers direct opportunities to demonstrate core software engineering principles â€” from modular design and testable architecture, to agile planning, version control, and automated validation â€” in line with the learning outcomes of the Software Engineering module (NCHNAP688).
