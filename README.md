# SECTION 1 â€“ PROJECT PROPOSAL

## Project Name: ToDone

ToDone is a simple and user-friendly to-do list web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users record, complete, and manage tasks in a lightweight interface.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Purpose

The goal of ToDone is to provide a lightweight productivity tool for time-pressured employees, students, or self-employed individuals. Unlike complex task platforms, ToDone is intentionally minimal. Users can quickly add, view, and clear tasks without requiring registration or an internet connection. This simplicity makes it ideal as a small-scale side project, well suited for applying professional software engineering practices.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Rationale for Choosing This Project

ToDone was selected because:

- Itâ€™s easy to implement using core front-end technologies (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).
- It aligns with modular design and agile workflows â€” one task = one feature.
- It supports test-driven development (TDD) and continuous integration (CI).

The simplicity of the idea makes it easier to:
- Focus on engineering discipline (version control, CI/CD)
- Deliver meaningful planning via GitHub Projects
- Conduct usability testing and clear documentation

---

### ðŸ”¹ Relevance to Workplace Practice

Although not yet a client-facing tool, ToDone has been valuable for applying best practices used at work, such as:

- Kanban-based agile planning (via GitHub Projects)
- Branching and pull request workflows
- Test automation foundations using GitHub Actions

This strengthens professional practice by demonstrating transferable skills from personal development to enterprise software delivery.
