### ðŸ”¹ Purpose

The goal of ToDone is to provide a lightweight productivity tool for time-pressed employees, students, or self-employed individuals. Unlike complex task platforms, ToDone is intentionally minimal. Users can quickly add, view, and clear tasks without requiring registration or an internet connection. This simplicity makes it ideal as a small-scale side project, well suited for applying professional software engineering practices.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Rationale

This project was selected because of its:

- Simplicity and clarity â€“ easy to implement with front-end technologies
- Strong modular design potential â€“ aligns with best practices in software architecture
- Suitability for agile planning and iterative delivery â€“ enabling the use of modern project management and CI/CD pipelines

It provides a solid platform to demonstrate:

- Planning using GitHub Projects
- Incremental development with Git
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions

---

### ðŸ”¹ Relevance to Workplace

While this app is not a client-facing product at this stage, it serves as a testbed for applying real-world software engineering principles and reflects key workplace practices. This includes:

- Kanban-based agile planning via GitHub Projects
- Branching and pull request workflows
- Test automation practices using GitHub Actions

ToDone demonstrates transferable software engineering skills useful in both academic and professional environments.
